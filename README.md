# golang-dtqs

A high-performance distributed task queue system built with Go and Redis, designed for scalable background job processing in microservices architectures.

## Overview

golang-dtqs provides a robust, Redis-backed task queue solution that enables distributed processing of background jobs with built-in reliability features. The system is designed to handle high-throughput workloads while maintaining fault tolerance and horizontal scalability.

## Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Distributed Task Processing** - Multi-worker architecture for concurrent job execution across multiple nodes
- **Priority Queue Management** - Task prioritization with configurable priority levels for critical job handling
- **Automatic Retry Logic** - Intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff for failed tasks
- **RESTful API** - Complete HTTP API for task management, monitoring, and system control
- **Horizontal Scaling** - Seamless worker scaling to handle varying workload demands

### Reliability & Performance
- **Persistent Storage** - Redis-backed queue storage ensuring task durability
- **Dead Letter Queues** - Failed task isolation and manual intervention capabilities
- **Health Monitoring** - Built-in metrics and health check endpoints
- **Graceful Shutdown** - Safe worker termination without task loss

### Components
- **Redis**: Centralized queue storage, task persistence, and pub/sub messaging
- **HTTP API Server**: RESTful interface for task submission and system management
- **Worker Pool**: Distributed Go workers for parallel task processing
- **Load Balancer**: Traffic distribution and high availability
